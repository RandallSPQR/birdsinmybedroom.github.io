## About Jess - 

Jessica (Jess) Coghan finds her slice of serenity in northern New Jersey, where her backyard has become a bustling sanctuary for local birds and native plants. After spending over a decade in the fast-paced worlds of fashion and advertising, Jess now balances her creative endeavors with raising three energetic boys who have inherited her curiosity about the natural world.

Her journey into bird watching began as a simple morning ritual with her coffee by the window, but it has evolved into a passionate pursuit of understanding the delicate connections between local wildlife, seasonal changes, and the ecosystem she's cultivating in her garden. Through "Birds in My Bedroom," Jess shares her observations and photographs, weaving together her professional eye for aesthetics with her deep appreciation for nature's intricate design. When she's not documenting her feathered visitors, you'll find her teaching her sons about gardening or sketching the wildlife that makes their home feel like a small piece of wilderness.
